		<!--COMMENT:	All process launched will be included, except for what matches a rule below. It's best to be as specific as possible, to
			avoid user-mode executables imitating other process names to avoid logging, or if malware drops files in an existing directory.
			Ultimately, you must weigh CPU time checking many detailed rules, against the risk of malware exploiting the blindness created.
			Beware of Masquerading, where attackers imitate the names and paths of legitimate tools. Ideally, you'd use both file path and
			code signatures to validate, but Sysmon does not support that. Look into Windows Device Guard for whitelisting support. -->
